# MovieArena

MovieArena is a web application that allows users to discover and search for movies. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can browse through a vast collection of movies, view detailed information about each movie, and even watch trailers. The project is hosted on GitHub and is open-source, meaning that anyone can contribute to its development.

## Features

- **Movie Search**: Users can search for movies using keywords. The app retrieves relevant movie results and displays them to the user.

- **Movie Details**: Each movie has a dedicated page that showcases detailed information such as title, release year, rating, synopsis, and genre. Additionally, users can view the movie's trailer.

- **Sorting and Filtering**: Users can sort and filter movie results based on various criteria, such as release year, rating, and genre. This helps users find movies that align with their preferences.

- **Responsive Design**: MovieArena is built with a responsive design approach, ensuring that the application adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

## Tech Stack

The MovieArena project utilizes the following technologies and frameworks:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a component-based architecture that facilitates the development of reusable UI elements.

- **Next.js**: A React framework that adds features such as server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and simpler configuration to React applications.

- **The Movie Database (TMDb) API**: An API that provides access to a vast collection of movie data, including movie details, ratings, and trailers. MovieArena leverages this API to retrieve movie information.

- **TailwindCSS**: Styling and design are achieved using TailwindCSS. The project may utilize CSS modules or a CSS-in-JS library to encapsulate styles and improve maintainability.
